# Stopwatch

In this Project, I Learned, 

1. To put an Image in the Background using CSS and to put a lower opacity layer on it.
   ```css
   background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)), url(./images/background.png);
   background-size: cover;
   background-position: center;
   ```
2. Use of clearInterval Method.
